# Breast_cancer_classification_supervised_ML

Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset (cancer, for short) records clinical measurements of breast cancer tumors. Each tumor is labeled as “benign” (for harmless tumors) or “malignant” (for cancerous tumors), and the task is to learn to predict whether a tumor is malignant based on the measurements of the tissue.

I have trained all the well known supervised ML classifiers such as: k-neighbors, logistic regression classifier, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, gradient boosted classifier, linear support classifier and a neural network classfier. All these models were evaulated using accuracy and the import features learned by them are plotted.
