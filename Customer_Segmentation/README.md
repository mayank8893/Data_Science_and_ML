# Customer_Segmentation

In this project, we are given a dataframe with information on customer gender, age, annual income and their spending score. Out task is to cluster these customers into **meaningful clusters** so that we can increase their spending score by giving them appropritae offers. We will firs process the data, then do some data exploration, then we will determing **the optimal number of clusters and apply k-means clustering**. Finally, we will visualize these clusters and make sure that they make sense.
