# Loan_default_prediction_using_ML

For this project, I want to look at the credit risk dataset and train a Machine learning (ML) model to predict whether the loan is going to default or not. The credit risk dataset has information about the age, income, homeownership, employment length, loan intent and 6 more variables along with actual information about whether the loan defaulted as Y/N. **I want to train a classifier that can predict whether a loan is going to default given a set of parameters.** First, I will train a Decision Tree classifier and then improve on it with a Random Forest classifier to study on a training set of data and make a prediction on a test set.

I will go through all the usual data analysis steps of **loading and cleaning the data, exploratory data analysis via outlier detection and correlation matrix, encode the labels for ML, split the data into training and test set, do a grid search to find optimal hyperparameters of the model and finally measure the performance of the ML model.** Please see the Jupyter notebook loan_default_analysis.ipynb.
