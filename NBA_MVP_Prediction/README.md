# NBA_MVP_Prediction
In this project, I have tried to predict the NBA MVP. My ML algorithm predicts the **top 5 on the MVP list with 82% accuracy**. In the first part of this project, I will scrape MVP, all players and teams data from basketball reference using **beautiful soup** and **selenium**. For the second part I have used the three csv files called mvps.csv, players.csv and teams.csv and I have **explored each dataset and cleaned it** as the situation demanded. Finally, I have done some **exploratory data analysis**. Finally, I have looked at the csv file player_mvp_stats.csv and try to predict the MVP using **Ridge regression and Random Forest regression**. First, I will clean the data. Then, I will define the ridge regression model and train it and then test it using an **error metric which measures how many tries it took the algo. to get the top 5 MVPs**. After that, I will create a **back testing** function that tests the model for all the previous years. Finally I will add some new predictors to improve the model and apply Random Forest Rgression to improve the predictions. **The algorithm correctly predicts the top 5 MVPs 82% of the time**.
