# Spam_or_Ham_Classifier

In this project, I will look at the SMS Spam Collection Dataset with the text of 5572 SMSs and a label classifying them as "spam" or "ham". I will **clean the data** first, then pre-process it using **tf-idf for natural language processing** and finally train and evaluate multiple **classification models** on the data. Most of the models work very well with 98% accuracy.
