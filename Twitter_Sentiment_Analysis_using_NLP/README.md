# Twitter_Sentiment_Analysis_using_NLP

The aim of this project is to classify a tweet as positive sentiment or negative (sexist/racist) sentiment. I have a data file twitter_sentiment_analysis.csv with information about the ID of the tweet, label of the tweet as 0 for positive sentiment 1 for negative sentiment and the actual text with text. The data has been cleaned, tokenized for NLP and then a ML model has been trained using logistic regression for classification of a test set into positive/negative sentiment tweet.
